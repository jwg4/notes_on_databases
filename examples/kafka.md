# Kafka
- Java
- http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/
- https://github.com/apache/kafka

## What it does
- Publish/subscribe
- Storage of events
- Basic querying of events

## Thoughts 
- Does it solve the problem?
- Is it a starting point? (Java!)
- Is it a reference for performance?
- Is it a protocol to re-implement?
