# Kafka
- Java
- http://kafka.apache.org/documentation/
- https://github.com/apache/kafka

## What it does
- Publish/subscribe (by topic)
- Storage of events. With a default cutoff in time (or storage space?)
- Basic querying of events. All queries are infinite.
- Stream processing. This is really good and doesn't have any counterpart.

## What it doesn't do?
- Complex processing inside of events?

## Queries
- Can we daisy-chain Kafka instances?

## Thoughts 
- Does it solve the problem?
- Is it a starting point? (Java!)
- Is it a reference for performance?
- Is it a protocol to re-implement?
